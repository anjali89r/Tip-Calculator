# tip-calculator

## Description
```
 Tip calculator is built with Vue.js using Veutify.js. The app calculates the total bill amount including tip and also splits bill based on the party size.

Tasks:

Completed - MVP: The user should be able to enter their bill in an input and select from a dropdown the percentage of tip. When they press the calculate button, the tip and total bill (with tip) amount will show.

Completed - Bronze: Validate inputs and show messages if the inputs are incorrect. Vuelidate is a good library for this.

Partially Completed (not used Cleave.js) - Silver: Add the ability to split the bill in your dinner party.

Completed -Gold: Conditionally change the style of the app depending on how good your tip is

Not Completed - Platinum: Use jest to unit test your component
